      <dd>
        <p>S.P.A.C.E Organizing is a professional organization company that creates "Strategically Planned And Customized Environments" using the 5 C's of Organization: Consider, Categorize, Cleanse, Contain and Customize. 
        <p>Our purpose is to organize and systemize your space to calm your mind and to save you time. What we spend our time on matters because once we spend it, we donâ€™t get it back. We help you free up your SPACE, time, and mental energy to improve your quality of life. We are here to help you find time to do more of the things you need and love to do; from taking a nap, to quality time with your family and friends, to reading a book, or improving productivity in your workplace. 
      </dd>
      <dt>Unique contribution:</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>What makes us unique is the process we use to identify your core needs and blocks around maintaining some sense of physical order in your external environment. In order to create a system that can work for your needs, we need to understand you. 
        <p>S.P.A.C.E Organizations is a judgment free zone that is safe for all. We do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, relationship style, physical and mental limitations, religion or family history.
