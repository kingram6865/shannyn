      <dt>What we do in a nutshell:</dt>
      <dd>      
        <p>S.P.A.C.E. Organization helps you intentionally organize your surroundings and create individualized systems to help get you on track and teach you how to maintain on your own. We achieve this using <span class="thefivecs">The 5 C's of Organization&trade;</span> (a method developed by Shannyn):</p>
        <ul class="nodefault">
          <li><span class="fivecs">Consider</span> your needs (most important step- sets the stage for the final outcome)</li>
          <li><span class="fivecs">Categorize</span> your belongings </li>
          <li><span class="fivecs">Cleanse</span> what doesn't serve you</li>
          <li><span class="fivecs">Contain</span> what does serve you</li>
          <li><span class="fivecs">Customize</span> to suit your individual needs and limitations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What you can expect the steps of the process to look like</p>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Schedule a consultation</span>- Requires approval. Please allow up to 48 hrs to get confirmation of your appt.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Fill out the Intake Form</span>- This will be in the inbox of the email you provided, with your appt confirmation.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Consultation</span>- We tour the space(s) and talk about your needs and what is not working for you. Should you choose to move forward we will sign the Scope of Project Contract at this stage.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Develop the plan</span>- Shannyn will take home photos and notes from our discussion to develop your customized plan.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Sign Scope of Project Contract</span>- Once you approve the plan you sign the contract that includes the scope, price and timeline of the project and I collect the deposit.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Do the work!</span>- I come into your space and implement the approved plan.</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Orient the client</span>- You come into the space and I orient you to where your things are and the systems I have implemented</li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Collect final payment</span></li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Provide a testimonial and refer your friends!</span></li>
          <li><span class="processsteps">Follow Up</span> <span class="optional">(optional)</span>- Sometimes something we think will work but in your day functioning in the space you find that it actually doesnâ€™t. Three months after completion of the job I am available to come back in (for a fee) and make adjustments to ensure your needs are fully met.</li>
