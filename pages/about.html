        <dd>
          <p>Shannyn was born and raised in the Bay Area.</p>
          
          <p>She has a Bachelor’s in Nursing and loves that work but organizing is her passion.</p>
          
          <p>The skills she has developed in the medical field have uniquely positioned her well in the industry of professional organizing as she 
          has a keen sense of the most intimate and vulnerable contributions that lend to the needs requiring support for her clients.</p>
          
          <p>Sure, she can come in and move your things around and make it look pretty (which she is so willing to do) but it’s her skills in 
          helping her clients feel at ease as she moves through their personal space and how she supports them through the often difficult 
          choices that arise through this process that make her special.</p>
